Game mode selection:
CLASSIC - you have as much time as you want for the gameplay, as the game only ends when the blocks
no longer fit on the board, i.e., they exceed the top line of the board.

TIME RUSH - the game ends when the time displayed on the side panel elapses, or when you exceed 
the top line of the board, just like in the CLASSIC option.

Controls:
~ Right arrow - move the block "1" step to the right.
~ Left arrow - move the block "1" step to the left.
~ Down arrow - accelerate the block's descent.
~ 'Z' key - rotate the block 90 degrees to the left.
~ 'X' key - rotate the block 90 degrees to the right.
~ 'C' key - place the block at the bottom of the current path.
~ 'P' key - pause/resume the game.
~ 'Esc' key - return to the menu.
Buttons:
In the game panel, there is a button labeled "MENU" that allows you to return to the menu panel, 
but pressing it erases the current progress of the game and does not save the score to the ranking!
Pressing the 'X' button in the top right corner completely closes the game.

Adding to the ranking:
To add your score to the ranking after finishing the game, enter your name in the window that 
appears after the game ends and press the "BECOME DARK SPIRIT" button. If you instead close the 
window without pressing that button, your score will not be added to the ranking!

Sound:
You control the volume of the background music using a slider in the menu panel. Setting the slider 
to 0 mutes the music completely. Volume control is only possible from the MENU panel.
