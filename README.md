This is a project made by a two-person team in the java programming language. Its goals were to recreate the popular game Tetris. 
The project was done as part of learning the java programming language.
The original project had a soundtrack, but due to file upload size limitations, the sound file was not included. 
My main task in this project was to create the interface of the game: start panel, game panel, navigation in the program, 
background music with the possibility of its adjustment by the user, multilingualism, the ability of the user to add a score to the scrolling ranking table.
